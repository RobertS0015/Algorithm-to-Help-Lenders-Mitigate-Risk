In this project, a fictional bank, N. R. Bank Inc., is trying to make use of some of their
customer data. As with any bank or credit system, people are going to default on payments for
one reason or another. Defaults are very costly for banks and N. R. Bank is currently feeling the
effects. They have all this data, and they’re hoping they can make use of it to solve this problem.
Fortunately for N. R. Bank, we can do just that. We’ll make use of algorithms with machine
learning techniques to help them be able to identify low and high risk borrowers.
